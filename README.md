# Patterns: An open source translator to convert reasoning traces, into fundamental cognitive primitives

Glad you found this. This library is meant to allow researchers and practitioners to grab the scapel, and diagnose with rigourus analytical expression the cognitive modallity their models are fundamentally thinking in. To this extent, we propose a clear roadmap to AGI as the satisfaction of a criteria. In the framework of deep psychology, eight modalities for human cognition are proposed distinguished in four dimensions: each having an extraverted and an introverted counterpart. We thus have feeling, thinking, intuition and sensing. If a model is capable of thinking in terms of all 8 modalities while intertwining the modalities in meaningful patterns, we can safely assume that the model is in fact thinking like a human being. Divided into their ambivalences the functions can be derived as following:

- Introverted Feeling (Fi)
- Extraverted Feeling (Fe)
- Introverted Intuition (Ni)
- Extraverted Intuition (Ne)
- Introverted Thinking (Ti)
- Extraverted Thinking (Te)
- Introverted Sensing (Si)
- Extraverted Sensing (Se)


Extensive research and theorycrafting has suggest us over the years, that these functions can be intertwined together into patterns, as if they were chemical compounds. Furthermore each of these functions, has a direct equivalent as a mathematical operation (Fi: Group Mean, Ti: Kolmogorov Complexity Minimization, Te: Regression,...etc). We have found GRPO to only cover the functional axis of Fi with Te, which both together compound as Fi -> Te. This is clearly not enough to achieve general reasoning capabilities as many dimensions of cognition are still mising. For this purpose we introduce *Patterns* as a powerful tool to understand everyday language as an intricate web of simple mathematical operations. This is a fundamental and groundbreaking shift into how we think about language, AI and human psychology; and hopefully an engineered way to architect reasoning modalities, obtaining complete control over the thinking patterns a model has, giving us the capacity of architecting a true personality for an LLM and general reasoning capabilities.
